                <p>
                  Studies have identified a link between regular alcohol consumption and an increased risk of breast cancer. report that alcohol may increase estrogen levels and cause damage to DNA. They also note that women who drink three alcoholic beverages per week increase their risk of developing breast cancer by 15%.

                  In research from 2016, mice that ate a diet that was as rich in sugar as the typical diet in the U.S. were more likely to develop mammary gland tumors similar to breast cancer in humans.

               A healthy diet can help reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and certain cancer types. A healthy diet can also help you get to and stay at a healthy weight. Overweight and obesity increase the risk for getting breast cancer. What's less clear is the link between breast cancer risk and any one food type.

            <p>
               Generally speaking, research shows that eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, poultry, and low-fat dairy products may have a positive impact on cancer survival. In contrast, eating processed foods, high-sugar foods, or fried foods may have a negative impact.
               And consuming low-fat dairy products can reduce your risk of low bone mass in the future.
