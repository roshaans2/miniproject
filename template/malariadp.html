               When one thinks of Monsoons, the thought of Malaria is not far behind. It is a protozoal disease that weakens the immune system. This happens because of the heavy antibiotics used to treat the disease. 
               Malaria is characterised by chills followed by fever, headache, diarrhoea, vomiting, etc.
             </p>
             <br>
             <p>
               To treat malaria, there is no specific diet, but one needs to ensure adequate nutrition to help the body fight the disease. A diet for malaria should focus on boosting the immune system without 
               causing harm to other organs like the kidney, liver or digestive system. It is best that a malaria patient has smaller meals throughout the day.
             </p>
             <br>
             <p>
               When the patient has a malarial fever, the bodyâ€™s calorie and nutritional requirement increases. This is known as the BMR or Body Metabolic Rate. Also, 
               the need to increase calorie intake depends on the rise in body temperature.

                 <h3>1. Increase Protein Intake</h3>
                 <br>

                 <p>
                  There is an increase in the requirement of protein as one loose a lot of tissue. A diet of high carbohydrate and high protein is helpful as the body 
                  can utilise the protein for anabolic and tissue repair and building process. Eating curd, lassi and buttermilk is highly beneficial. High temperature makes 
                  the body weak and reduces appetite. Food rich in protein helps to synthesize immune bodies, which can help to fight parasites.

                 <h3>2. Increase Fluid Intake</h3>
                 <br>

                 <p>
                  Unfortunately, at the time of fever, one experiences appetite loss, less tolerance and therefore, eating food becomes a challenge. To compensate for such a situation, one must
                   drink glucose water, fresh fruit juices, coconut water, a sorbet made with lemon, salt, sugar and water and electoral water.

                 <h3>3. Eat Fat in Moderation</h3>
                 <br>

                 <p>
                  Fats are necessary for the body, but moderation is the key.  Using dairy fats like cream, butter and fats from milk products aid indigestion. These foods contain MCT or medium change triglycerides. 
                  Using excessive fats or eating fried foods can increase the risk of nausea, indigestion and loose bowels.

                 <h3>4. Eat Nutritious Foods</h3>
                 <br>

                 <p>
                  Consume a high carbohydrate diet. Choose rice over wheat and millets. Rice can be digested easily and can release energy faster. Fresh fruits and vegetables work wonders for malaria patients.
                   According to studies, vitamin A and vitamin C rich fruits and vegetables like beetroot, carrot, papaya, sweet lime, grapes, berries, lemon, orange help to detoxify and boost the 
                   immunity of the patient suffering from malaria.
