            <h1>1. Kapalbhati (Skull shining breath.)</h1>
            <br>

            <p>
                Kapalbhati is a pranayama yoga pose. It improves oneâ€™s general immune system. Pranayama yoga is known to 
                remove up to 80 per cent of the toxins in your body. The essential part of pranayama yoga is controlled breathing.<br> 
                Process:
            </p>
            <br>

            <ul>
                <li>Sit comfortably on a yoga mat/blanket.</li>
                <li>Inhale deeply through your nose.</li>
                <li>While inhaling, pull your stomach inward as much as possible.</li>
                <li>Exhale through your nose.</li>
                <li>Repeat this for 20 minutes a day.</li>
            </ul>

               <p>
                This is another pranayama yoga pose focused on easing pains and worries related to the disease. 
                This exercise is extremely beneficial for people dealing with pneumonia. It not only clears the mind but also helps with breathing difficulties.<br>
                Process:
               </p>
               <br>
   
               <ul>

                  <h1>3. Ustrasana (Camel pose)</h1>
                  <br>
      
                  <p>
                    Easy Pose or Sukhasana, is a foundational posture used for seated meditation instead of Lotus Pose (like the one stated above). 
                    This pose is a little complex as compared to the Bhastrika Pranayama.<br>
                    Process:
                  </p>
                  <br>
      
                  <ul>
                      <li>Kneel on the yoga mat and place your hands on the hips</li>
                      <li>Simultaneously, arch your back and slide your palms over your feet till the arms are straight.</li>
                      <li>Do not strain or flex your neck but keep it in a neutral position.</li>
                      <li>Stay in this posture for a couple of breaths.</li>
                      <li>Breathe out and slowly come back to the initial pose.</li>
                      <li>Withdraw your hands and bring them back to your hips as you straighten up.</li>
                      <li>Do not hold this posture for a long duration. </li>

                  <p>
                    Dandasana is a simple seated pose that strengthens the deep muscles of your lower back, your abdomen, and your muscles deep in the pelvis. 
                    This improves your overall posture and builds a solid foundation for the healthy alignment of your spine.<br>

                  <p>
                    Nirvana Pranayam is a breathing routine devised to make your breaths more effective by making them slower.IT helps in regulating the breath 
                    and re-orienting the functions of the mind and the body. In addition to that it also helps in regulating the oxygen in the blood that leads to a 
                    healthy body condition to live as well as fight toxicity and infections within that can occur from time to time, given the new age life condition we are exposed to.<br>
