                <li>Place your palms on your knees or on your thighs and adjust your pelvis slightly backward and forward until you're comfortable. </li>

                   <li>Lower the crown (very top) of your head back until it comes to the floor, opening your throat.</li>
                   <li>Keep your legs engaged and your toes active throughout.</li>

                   <li>Then release your upper body to the mat.</li>
