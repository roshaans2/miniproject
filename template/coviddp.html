                Nutrition plays a significant role for both, the COVID-19 patients and those who are on the path of recovery. During COVID-19, the body gets weakened and it continues for days even after recovering from the symptoms. Thus, it becomes essential to consume the right kind of diet for a speedy and complete recovery of the body.Start with meeting 50% of the nutritional requirement of the patient and proceed to 70% by the 3rd day, gradually increasing to 100% by the end of the week.

		        Having a balanced diet with moderate carbs and fats, and High Biological Value proteins.
		        Provide Oral Nutrition Supplements and Antioxidants to meet the demands of the patients.

                When you eat extra calories and fat, your body creates an undesirable rise in blood glucose. 
                If blood glucose isn't kept in check, it can lead to serious problems, such as a high blood glucose level (hyperglycemia) that, 
                if persistent, may lead to long-term complications, such as nerve, kidney and heart damage.

                 <h3>1. Eat fresh and unprocessed foods every day</h3>
                 <br>

                 <p>
                Eat fruits, vegetables, legumes (e.g. lentils, beans), nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat, brown rice or starchy tubers or roots such as potato, yam, taro or cassava), and foods from animal sources (e.g. meat, fish, eggs and milk).Do not overcook vegetables and fruit as this can lead to the loss of important vitamins.When using canned or dried vegetables and fruit, choose varieties without added salt or sugar.

                 <h3>2. Drink enough water every day </h3>
                 <br>

                 <p>
                   Water is essential for life. It transports nutrients and compounds in blood, regulates your body temperature, gets rid of waste, and lubricates and cushions joints.Drink 8–10 cups of water every day.Water is the best choice, but you can also consume other drinks, fruits and vegetables that contain water, for example lemon juice (diluted in water and unsweetened), tea and coffee. But be careful not to consume too much caffeine, and avoid sweetened fruit juices, syrups, fruit juice concentrates, fizzy and still drinks as they all contain sugar.

                 <br>

                 <p>
                   Consume unsaturated fats (e.g. found in fish, avocado, nuts, olive oil, soy, canola, sunflower and corn oils) rather than saturated fats (e.g. found in fatty meat, butter, coconut oil, cream, cheese, ghee and lard).Choose white meat (e.g. poultry) and fish, which are generally low in fat, rather than red meat.Avoid processed meats because they are high in fat and salt.Where possible, opt for low-fat or reduced-fat versions of milk and dairy products.Avoid industrially produced trans fats. These are often found in processed food, fast food, snack food, fried food, frozen pizza, pies, cookies, margarines and spreads.

                 <br>

                 <p>
                    Eat at home to reduce your rate of contact with other people and lower your chance of being exposed to COVID-19. We recommend maintaining a distance of at least 1 metre between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. That is not always possible in crowded social settings like restaurants and cafes. Droplets from infected people may land on surfaces and people’s hands (e.g. customers and staff), and with lots of people coming and going, you cannot tell if hands are being washed regularly enough, and surfaces are being cleaned and disinfected fast enough.

               <p>
               Corona virus diease hurt your respiraotry system and makes your overall body weak and also reduces your cell counts, you should try limiting certain food items or nutrients that harm you. Some of these are:

                <h3>1. Avoid Packed and Processed Food</h3>
                <br>

                <p>
                The processed foods are high in salt increasing the probability of the patient suffering with inflammation and acidity. This can cause discomfort to the body and lead to further complications or symptoms like vomiting or stomach infection. Rather, consuming fresh food with less than five grams of salt daily is recommended by WHO. Also, one must avoid eating food from outside as it may be infected or unhygienic.
                </p>
                <br>

            </div>

             <div>

                <h3>2.Avoid intake of excess Fats</h3>
                <br>

                <p>
                    Saturated fats raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol and high LDL cholesterol increases the risk for heart disease and stroke, which is one of the main concerns in covid positive patients. Therefore, patients should not exceed more than 10% of saturated fats of their daily calorie intake. They should rather consume healthy fats like eggs, avocados (rich in fibre also) and dry fruits like nuts, almonds and cashews.
                </p>
                <br>

            </div>

             <div>

                <h3>3.  Avoid drinking coffee,tea or caffeinated fizzy drinks</h3>
                <br>

                <p>
                    It leads to dehydration of the body and might affect the sleeping pattern of the patient. Drink water as it helps to regulate human body temperature. Limit intake of packed sugary juices and fizzy drinks, thinking that they might energize the body, rather drink glucose water, fresh coconut water, hot vegetable soups or hot turmeric milk.

                <p>
                    Smoking while suffering from the virus can lead to breathing problems, stroke, lowering oxygen levels and affecting lungs.

                Eating a healthy diet is very important during the COVID-19 pandemic. What we eat and drink can affect our body’s ability to prevent, fight and recover from infections.While no foods or dietary supplements can prevent or cure COVID-19 infection, healthy diets are important for supporting immune systems. Good nutrition can also reduce the likelihood of developing other health problems, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes and some types of cancer.For babies, a healthy diet means exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months, with the introduction of nutritious and safe foods to complement breastmilk from age 6 months to 2 years and beyond. For young children, a healthy and balanced diet is essential for growth and development. For older people, it can help to ensure healthier and more active lives.
