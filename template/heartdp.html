                A Heart disease diet is a healthy-eating plan that's naturally rich in nutrients and low in fat and calories. 
                Key elements are fruits, vegetables and whole grains. In fact, a diabetes diet is the best eating plan for most everyone.
             </p>
             <br>
             <p>
               The cardiac diet emphasizes foods such as vegetables, whole grains, and oily fish. These foods are beneficial for heart health. The diet also limits processed foods that are high in sugar and salt, as these increase the risk of heart disease.

            </p>
             <br>
             <p>
                When you eat extra calories and fat, your body creates an undesirable rise in blood glucose. 
                If blood glucose isn't kept in check, it can lead to serious problems, such as a high blood glucose level (hyperglycemia) that, 
                if persistent, may lead to long-term complications, such as nerve, kidney and heart damage.

                 <p>
                  The phrase “eat the rainbow” is a useful way for people to remember to consume a variety of different colored fruits and vegetables each day. The different types of antioxidants that plant foods contain can help protect the heart.

                  <br>Fruits and vegetables are also a good source of fiber, which is essential for heart health.

                 <p>
                    Dietary fiber includes all parts of plant foods that your body can't digest or absorb. 
                    Fiber moderates how your body digests and helps control blood sugar levels. Foods high in fiber include:
                 </p>

                 <ul class="list">
                    <li>Nuts</li>
                    <li>Berries</li>

               </h3>
                 <br>

                 <p>
                    Eat heart-healthy fish at least twice a week. Fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna and sardines are 
                    rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which may prevent heart disease.
                    Avoid fried fish and fish with high levels of mercury, such as king mackerel.
