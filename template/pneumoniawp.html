                    Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung primarily affecting the small air sacs known as alveoli.Pneumonia 
                    is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria, and less commonly by other microorganisms.

                    The Winter Fever, as pneumonia was once known, has been traced back through history. Symptoms of pneumonia were first described by the Greek physician 
                    Hippocrates around 460 BC. Although it carried many names and was often identified as  a sickness, it wasn’t until the 19th century that scholars were 
                    able to identify pneumonia as its own infection, and not just a symptom of other diseases.

                    Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial pneumonia and it may take time to identify the 
                    type of bacteria causing your pneumonia and to choose the best antibiotic to treat it.
                    Cough medicine may be used to calm your cough so that you can rest. Because coughing helps loosen and 
                    move fluid from your lungs. Fever reducers/pain relievers may be taken for fever and discomfort. These 
                    include drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).

                    Pneumonia is typically due to infectious pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses. 
                    These pathogens can spread via coughing and sneezing or by contaminating surfaces that people touch.
                    In most cases, a person contracts pneumonia-causing pathogens by breathing them into the small air 
                    sacs, or alveoli, within their lungs. The immune system responds by sending white blood cells to attack 
                    the infection, which triggers inflammation of the alveoli. The alveoli fill with fluid and pus, causing pneumonia.
